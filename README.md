# ResumeGPT - Sowjanya's Resume bot

## Overview
This Streamlit application is an interactive chatbot showcasing your professional background and qualifications. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, it delivers accurate and context-aware answers based on your resume and other data stored in a CSV file. The chatbot utilizes a FAISS vector store for efficient information retrieval and the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model for answer generation. Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Features

- **RAG-based:** Employs a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, ensuring responses are both relevant and grounded in the information provided.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Enables users to ask questions and receive informative answers directly derived from the CSV data.
- **Conversation History:** Retains conversations in MongoDB Atlas for later review and analysis, enhancing user engagement.
- **Knowledge Awareness:** Gracefully handles situations where the chatbot lacks the information to answer a question, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Question Suggestions:** Offers prompts to guide users and encourage meaningful conversations, promoting deeper exploration of your qualifications.




## Prerequisites

```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

2. The application will open in your default web browser. First time it will run a bit longer indexing the csv file and storing it in a FAISS vector store. 
3. Ask questions about your background and qualifications, and the chatbot will provide relevant responses.

## Publishing your app

1. Once you commit all your files to **GitHub**, create an account in [**Streamlit.io** ](https://share.streamlit.io/)preferably with your GitHub account.

2. Click on the `New app` option:

3. Input your `OPENAI_API_KEY`  and `mongodB_pass` using the **Advanced settings...** option

4. Click on **Deploy** button

### Note

You can also deploy the same on **[HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)**. You can find more documentation on the same [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-streamlit).

## Configuration

- The application uses a FAISS index to store the CSV and PDF data embeddings. If the index file (`faiss_index`) does not exist, it will be created automatically and it will take several minutes to generate all embeddings. 
- The CSV data file path is set in the `data_source` variable, and the PDF resume file path is set in the `pdf_source` variable.
